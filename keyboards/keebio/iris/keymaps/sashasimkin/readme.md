#### Keymap - ToDo

- LOWER+SHIFT - not sustaintable behavior - CTRL+SHIFT+T works, but ... doesn't
- CTRL+ENTER - sucks, find out where to move SHIFT+INS
- get finer controls for underglow https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/hardware-features/lighting/feature_rgblight#keycodes
- MAC - Mod-Tap finally?


#### Keymap - think about it
- CTRL+K - doesn't feel ok - maybe not that bad thou? - maybe to make double tap on LOWER=CTRL?
- Try mod tap for modifiers?

- Adjust layer + mods - doesn't do good, maybe move modifiers to thumb cluster or sth?

#### Keymap - validate
- Shift + Tilda - hurts!!! - RAISE + GRV = tilda
- underglow off when PC falls asleep

#### Keymap - done
- comment/uncomment gesture hurts - now you can do it with LOWER+Slash now
