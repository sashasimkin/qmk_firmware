#### Keymap - ToDo
- Re-think lower to be more useful, since you now using ModTaps
- Line start / Line end on Mac FFS
- Explore https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/advanced-keycodes/feature_leader_key for common tasks
    - E.g. a p - aplaybook
    - g s - git status<ENTER>
- Explore  dynamic macros (w/ LOWER layer, maybe?)

#### Keymap - think about it
- Highlight different layers https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_rgblight?id=lighting-layers
    - Not using highlight or layers that heavy :(
- https://docs.qmk.fm/features/caps_word

#### Keymap - validate

#### Keymap - done
- Maybe LOWER+ENTER should be space and RAISE+SPACE should be enter? so one-handed is not that painpul
  - The other way around lol
- That corner key - replace it w/ Print-screen
- Try mod tap for modifiers?
