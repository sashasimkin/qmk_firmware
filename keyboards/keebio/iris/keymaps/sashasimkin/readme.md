#### Keymap - ToDo
- Re-think lower to be more useful, since you now using ModTaps
- Highlight different layers https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_rgblight?id=lighting-layers
- Resolve sleeping issue (https://docs.qmk.fm/#/ref_functions?id=software-timers ?)
- Explore https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/advanced-keycodes/feature_leader_key for common tasks
    - E.g. a p - aplaybook
    - g s - git status<ENTER>
- Explore  dynamic macros (w/ LOWER layer, maybe?)
- EXPORE NKRO (LOWER TOO?)

#### Keymap - think about it
- CTRL+K - doesn't feel ok - maybe not that bad thou? - maybe to make double tap on LOWER=CTRL?
    
- Adjust layer + mods - doesn't do good, maybe move modifiers to thumb cluster or sth?

#### Keymap - validate
- Shift + Tilda - hurts!!! - RAISE + GRV = tilda
- underglow off when PC falls asleep
- MAC - Mod-Tap - finally!
- Try mod tap for modifiers?
    - https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/advanced-keycodes/mod_tap
    - https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/software-features/tap_hold
- get finer controls for underglow https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/hardware-features/lighting/feature_rgblight#keycodes

#### Keymap - done
- comment/uncomment gesture hurts - now you can do it with LOWER+Slash now
